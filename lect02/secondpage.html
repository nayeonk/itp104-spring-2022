		<h2>About</h2>
		<p><span>P</span>ikachu is a species of Pok√©mon, fictional creatures that appear in an assortment of media of the Pok√©mon franchise by The Pok√©mon Company. Pikachu is a yellow mouse-like Pok√©mon with powerful electrical abilities. Pikachu is the best-known species of Pok√©mon, largely due to its appearance in the anime series as the starter Pok√©mon of the protagonist, Ash Ketchum. Pikachu is a major character of the Pok√©mon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years, as well as one of the major mascots for Nintendo.</p>
		<p>Pikachu‚Äôs design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori. Pikachu first appeared in Pok√©mon Red and Green in Japan, and later in the first internationally released Pok√©mon video games, Pok√©mon Red and Blue, for the Game Boy.</p>
